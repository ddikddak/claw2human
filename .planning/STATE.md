## Blockers

1. **Tech Stack Decisions** - Need user input on:
   - Backend framework
   - Database
   - Frontend approach
   - Auth provider
   - Hosting strategy
   - MVP scope

---

## Ready to Start (Phase 2)

Once decisions are made:
1. Initialize monorepo with chosen stack
2. Set up Docker Compose
3. Create database schema
4. Bootstrap backend + frontend

---

## Notes

- User wants iterative approach with validation at each step
- Do NOT proceed with implementation until decisions confirmed
- Present options with pros/cons, let user choose
